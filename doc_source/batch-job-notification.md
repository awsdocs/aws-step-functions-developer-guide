# Manage a Batch Job \(AWS Batch, Amazon SNS\)<a name="batch-job-notification"></a>

This sample project demonstrates how to submit an AWS Batch job, and then send an Amazon SNS notification based on whether that job succeeds or fails\. Deploying this sample project creates a Step Functions state machine, an AWS Batch job, and an Amazon SNS topic\. 

In this project, Step Functions uses a state machine to call the AWS Batch job synchronously\. It then waits for the job to succeed or fail, and it sends an Amazon SNS topic with a message about whether the job succeeded or failed\.

**To create the Manage a Batch Job state machine and provision all resources**

1. Open the [Step Functions console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/) and choose **Create a state machine**\.

1. Choose **Sample Projects**, and then choose **Manage a Batch Job**\.

   The state machine **Code** and **Visual Workflow** are displayed\.  
![\[Manage AWS Batch workflow.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/images/sample-manage-batch.png)

1. Choose **Next**\.

   The **Deploy resources** page is displayed, listing the resources that will be created\. For this sample project, the resources include:
   + An AWS Batch job
   + An Amazon SNS topic

1. Choose **Deploy Resources**\.
**Note**  
It can take up to 10 minutes for these resources and related IAM permissions to be created\. While the **Deploy resources** page is displayed, you can open the **Stack ID** link to see which resources are being provisioned\.

## Start a New Execution<a name="sample-batch-start-execution"></a>

1. On the **New execution** page, enter an execution name \(optional\), and then choose **Start Execution**\.

1. \(Optional\) To help identify your execution, you can specify an ID for it in the **Enter an execution name** box\. If you don't enter an ID, Step Functions generates a unique ID automatically\.
**Note**  
Step Functions allows you to create state machine, execution, and activity names that contain non\-ASCII characters\. These non\-ASCII names don't work with Amazon CloudWatch\. To ensure that you can track CloudWatch metrics, choose a name that uses only ASCII characters\.

1. Optionally, you can go to the newly created state machine on the Step Functions **Dashboard**, and then choose **New execution**\.

1. When an execution is complete, you can select states on the **Visual workflow** and browse the **Input** and **Output** under **Step details**\.

## Example State Machine Code<a name="sample-batch-code-examples"></a>

The state machine in this sample project integrates with AWS Batch and Amazon SNS by passing parameters directly to those resources\. 

Browse through this example state machine to see how Step Functions controls AWS Batch and Amazon SNS by connecting to the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) in the `Resource` field, and by passing `Parameters` to the service API\.

For more information about how AWS Step Functions can control other AWS services, see [AWS Service Integrations](concepts-service-integrations.md)\.

## IAM Example<a name="sample-batch-iam-example"></a>

This example AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policy generated by the sample project includes the least privilege necessary to execute the state machine and related resources\. We recommend that you include only those permissions that are necessary in your IAM policies\. 

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "sns:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": [

        },
        {

                "batch:DescribeJobs",
                "batch:TerminateJob"
            ],

        },
