# Synchronous and Asynchronous Express Workflows<a name="concepts-express-synchronous"></a>

There are two types of Express Workflows that you can choose, Asynchronous Express Workflows and Synchronous Express Workflows\. 
+  **Asynchronous Express Workflows** return confirmation that the workflow was started, but do not wait for the workflow to complete\. To get the result, you must poll the service's [CloudWatch Logs](cw-logs.md)\. Asynchronous Express Workflows can be used when you don't require immediate response output, such as messaging services, or data processing that other services don't depend on\. Asynchronous Express Workflows can be started in response to an event, by a nested workflow in Step Functions, or by using the `[StartExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_StartExecution.html)` API call\. 
+  **Synchronous Express Workflows** start a workflow, wait until it completes, then return the result\. Synchronous Express Workflows can be used to orchestrate microservices, and allow you to develop applications without the need to develop additional code to handle errors, retries, or execute parallel tasks\. Synchronous Express Workflows can be invoked from Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, or by using the `[StartSyncExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_StartSyncExecution.html)` API call\. 

  Synchronous Express execution API calls do not contribute to the existing account capacity limits\. Step Functions will provide capacity on demand and will automatically scale with sustained workload\. Surges in workload may be throttled until capacity is available\. 
**Note**  
Amazon VPC endpoints are not supported by Synchronous Express Workflows\.
